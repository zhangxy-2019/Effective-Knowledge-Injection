Braumoeller  - Wikipedia> Bear F. Braumoeller was an American political scientist studying international conflict, international order, statistical methodology, and computational models. At the time of his death (May 2, 2023) he was a Professor of Political Science at The Ohio State University, where he held the Baronov and Timashev Chair in Data Analytics. He founded the MESO (Modelling Emergent Social Order) Lab and co-led the Computational Social Science Community of Practice at Ohio State's Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI). Braumoeller graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago in 1990 with a B.A. in Political Science writing his senior thesis under Stephen Walt. In 1998 he completed his PhD in Political Science at the University of Michigan under Robert Axelrod with a thesis titled \"Isolationism in International Relations.\" He began his career in 1998 as an assistant professor of Political Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, moving to Harvard University's Department of Government from 2000-2007, before arriving at Ohio State. He was a visiting fellow at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in 2016, and was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2021.\nWithin international relations, Braumoeller is best known for developing the first systemic theory of international relations amenable to statistical testing, culminating in his first book, The Great Powers and the International System: Systemic Theory in Empirical Perspective. The book synthesizes realist and liberal theories of international relations specifying the ways in which individual leaders create the contours of the system that in turn constrain their actions. The book won the 2014 Annual Best Book Award from the International Studies Association and the 2013 J. David Singer Book Award from the ISA-Midwest Conference. More recently Braumoeller published, Only the Dead: The Persistence of War in the Modern Age, the first book length critique of Steven Pinker's claims about the decline of violence in The Better Angels of Our Nature. Braumoeller argues that statistical analysis provides little evidence in support of the psychological mechanisms Pinker proposes, arguing instead that the rise of international institutions better account for declines in the interstate use of force. Within political methodology Braumoeller is best known for developing statistical tests tailored to the kinds of hypotheses common in the study of international relations, in particular, Boolean operators, multiplicative interaction terms, the analysis of necessary conditions, and computational models.\n\nBased on the paragraph above can we conclude that <Bear F.

Braumoeller  - Wikipedia> Bear F. Braumoeller was an American political scientist studying international conflict, international order, statistical methodology, and computational models. At the time of his death (May 2, 2023) he was a Professor of Political Science at The Ohio State University, where he held the Baronov and Timashev Chair in Data Analytics. He founded the MESO (Modelling Emergent Social Order) Lab and co-led the Computational Social Science Community of Practice at Ohio State's Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI). Braumoeller graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago in 1990 with a B.A. in Political Science writing his senior thesis under Stephen Walt. In 1998 he completed his PhD in Political Science at the University of Michigan under Robert Axelrod with a thesis titled \"Isolationism in International Relations.\" He began his career in 1998 as an assistant professor of Political Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, moving to Harvard University's Department of Government from 2000-2007, before arriving at Ohio State. He was a visiting fellow at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in 2016, and was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2021.\nWithin international relations, Braumoeller is best known for developing the first systemic theory of international relations amenable to statistical testing, culminating in his first book, The Great Powers and the International System: Systemic Theory in Empirical Perspective. The book synthesizes realist and liberal theories of international relations specifying the ways in which individual leaders create the contours of the system that in turn constrain their actions. The book won the 2014 Annual Best Book Award from the International Studies Association and the 2013 J. David Singer Book Award from the ISA-Midwest Conference. More recently Braumoeller published, Only the Dead: The Persistence of War in the Modern Age, the first book length critique of Steven Pinker's claims about the decline of violence in The Better Angels of Our Nature. Braumoeller argues that statistical analysis provides little evidence in support of the psychological mechanisms Pinker proposes, arguing instead that the rise of international institutions better account for declines in the interstate use of force. Within political methodology Braumoeller is best known for developing statistical tests tailored to the kinds of hypotheses common in the study of international relations, in particular, Boolean operators, multiplicative interaction terms, the analysis of necessary conditions, and computational models.\n\nBased on the paragraph above can we conclude that <Bear F.

Wood's Ferry and Wood's Bridge site is a California Historical Landmark No. 163, listed on Jan. 11. 1935. The Wood's Ferry was built by pioneer Jeremiah H. Woods, 1852, shortly after Woods arrived at Woodbridge and built his log cabin house. The cable ferry crossed the Mokelumne River at \"Wood's Ferry\". Wood built a toll bridge at the site of his ferry in August 1858 at a cost of $1,000 (about $37,000 in today's money). To cross the wooden bridge, Woods charged $1 (about $37 in today's money) for two animals pulling a wagon and $0.50 for any extra wagons the group may have. The toll took in $9,900 (about $366,000 in today's money) this first year. There is no marker at the site, there is modern bridge at the site on J10 at 19032 Lower Sacramento Road.\nJeremiah H. Woods and Alexander McQueen purchased land for Wood's Ferry from the Sargent brothers, J. P. Sargent and Roscoe S. Sargent, in 1852. The Sargent brothers grew barley crops on the surrounding land. Jeremiah H. Woods built the wooden cable ferry by hand at the river bank from local trees. In October 1852 John A. J. Flood and E. H. Comstock petitioned the Court of Sessions have a public road built from Stockton, and have it cross at Wood's ferry then on to Davis' bridge and on Dry creek (Fugett's). The court order designated the route as a county road, that helped Woods. In 1853 a flood washed out the road, so Woods organized a pack train and took Stockton supplies to miners that were unable to get the normal supply by wagon trains. Woods had to use row boats to cross the river with the goods. Later to boost travel, Woods gave the stagecoach free ferry crossing. The town at the ferry became known as \"Wood's Ferry\", and in 1859 became Woodbridge, named after Woods' bridge. On July 4, 1855, Woods used his new wealth to put on an expensive Independence Day dance for the town and travelers. In 1874 and free pubic bridge was built and the old toll-bridge was removed. Woods was paid $1,000 by the new bridge builders.\n\nBased on the paragraph above can we conclude that <Wood's Bridge> Wood's Bridge Site is located in Woodbridge, California.\n\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- It's impossible to say\n- No\n\nAnswer:",

Wood's Ferry and Wood's Bridge site is a California Historical Landmark No. 163, listed on Jan. 11. 1935. The Wood's Ferry was built by pioneer Jeremiah H. Woods, 1852, shortly after Woods arrived at Woodbridge and built his log cabin house. The cable ferry crossed the Mokelumne River at \"Wood's Ferry\". Wood built a toll bridge at the site of his ferry in August 1858 at a cost of $1,000 (about $37,000 in today's money). To cross the wooden bridge, Woods charged $1 (about $37 in today's money) for two animals pulling a wagon and $0.50 for any extra wagons the group may have. The toll took in $9,900 (about $366,000 in today's money) this first year. There is no marker at the site, there is modern bridge at the site on J10 at 19032 Lower Sacramento Road.\nJeremiah H. Woods and Alexander McQueen purchased land for Wood's Ferry from the Sargent brothers, J. P. Sargent and Roscoe S. Sargent, in 1852. The Sargent brothers grew barley crops on the surrounding land. Jeremiah H. Woods built the wooden cable ferry by hand at the river bank from local trees. In October 1852 John A. J. Flood and E. H. Comstock petitioned the Court of Sessions have a public road built from Stockton, and have it cross at Wood's ferry then on to Davis' bridge and on Dry creek (Fugett's). The court order designated the route as a county road, that helped Woods. In 1853 a flood washed out the road, so Woods organized a pack train and took Stockton supplies to miners that were unable to get the normal supply by wagon trains. Woods had to use row boats to cross the river with the goods. Later to boost travel, Woods gave the stagecoach free ferry crossing. The town at the ferry became known as \"Wood's Ferry\", and in 1859 became Woodbridge, named after Woods' bridge. On July 4, 1855, Woods used his new wealth to put on an expensive Independence Day dance for the town and travelers. In 1874 and free pubic bridge was built and the old toll-bridge was removed. Woods was paid $1,000 by the new bridge builders.\n\nBased on the paragraph above can we conclude that <Wood's Bridge> There is a modern bridge at the site of the historical Wood's Ferry and Wood's Bridge.\n\nOptions:\n- Yes\n- It's impossible to say\n- No\n\nAnswer:",
