He became one of the important artists of pop music with the albums he released since the mid-1990s. The artist, who had a career of nearly five years, stood out in the pop music market with the words he wrote and the songs he interpreted.\nInfluenced by many artists such as Kayahan, Sezen Aksu, Nil\u00fcfer and Fatih Erko\u00e7, Kerim Tekin decided to quit football in 1992 due to his passion for music, with the influence of guitar and singing education, and started his music career. He played guitar and sang in nightclubs and bars as an amateur, and also began to write his own songs. While playing in a nightclub, he was admired by the manager Halis B\u00fct\u00fcnley and discovered at that time. Kerim Tekin started to create the content of his first album professionally in 1994. He entered the market with his album \"Kara G\u00f6zl\u00fcm\" (1995). With this album, he succeeded in making his voice heard, and his acting career began by appearing in television series during this period. When he changed his style and image with his second album, \"Hayk\u0131rsam D\u00fcnyaya\" (1997), he started to appeal to large audiences. Kerim Tekin, who started writing lyrics with this album, worked with musicians such as Kenan Do\u011fulu, Ozan Do\u011fulu, Garo Mafyan, Zeynep Talu, \u015eehrazat, Ozan \u00c7olako\u011flu, \u0130skender Payda\u015f, Feyyaz Kuru\u015f and Tayfun Duygulu.",

      "output": "<The Papess Joanne  - Wikipedia> The Papess Joanne is a 1866 novel by Greek writter Emmanuel Rhoides. Published with the subtitle \"medieval study\", the novel is an exploration of the European legend of Pope Joan, a woman who secretely reigned as pope some time in the late ninth century. Though a romance with satirical overtones, it has been described as having elements of a chronicle because of the writer's extensive research of historical sources. Due to its religious commentary, the novel attracted criticism from the Greek Orthodox Church which resulted to its excommunication by the Holy Synod. \"Papess Joanne\" became the most famous of Rhoides' works and has been established as a classic of Modern Greek literature; It got translated into several languages, earning Rhoides worldwide recognition and praise.\nThe premise of the work is the medieval European legend of a woman named Joan who ascended the church hierarchy and assumed the papal throne disguised as a man. Joan's sex was supposedly revealed when she became pregnant and gave birth during a litany, whereupon she died. Rhoides wrote that he first heard about the legend in Genoa as a child. Intrigued by the story, he did extensive research in Germany, Italy, and finally the National Library of Greece, and collected significant material on the period in which the storyline takes place. \u0399n the preface of his book, the author lists a number of references, notes and footnotes, wanting to give a scientific appearance to his work. As emphasized by the subtitle \"medieval study\", Rhoides asserted the novel contained evidence that Pope Joan could have truly existed and that the Catholic Church attempted to cover up the fact for centuries.

At the time of his death (May 2, 2023) he was a Professor of Political Science at The Ohio State University, where he held the Baronov and Timashev Chair in Data Analytics. He founded the MESO (Modelling Emergent Social Order) Lab and co-led the Computational Social Science Community of Practice at Ohio State's Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI). Braumoeller graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago in 1990 with a B.A. in Political Science writing his senior thesis under Stephen Walt. In 1998 he completed his PhD in Political Science at the University of Michigan under Robert Axelrod with a thesis titled \"Isolationism in International Relations.\" He began his career in 1998 as an assistant professor of Political Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, moving to Harvard University's Department of Government from 2000-2007, before arriving at Ohio State. He was a visiting fellow at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in 2016, and was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2021.\nWithin international relations, Braumoeller is best known for developing the first systemic theory of international relations amenable to statistical testing, culminating in his first book, The Great Powers and the International System: Systemic Theory in Empirical Perspective. The book synthesizes realist and liberal theories of international relations specifying the ways in which individual leaders create the contours of the system that in turn constrain their actions. The book won the 2014 Annual Best Book Award from the International Studies Association and the 2013 J. David Singer Book Award from the ISA-Midwest Conference. More recently Braumoeller published, Only the Dead: The Persistence of War in the Modern Age, the first book length critique of Steven Pinker's claims about the decline of violence in The Better Angels of Our Nature. Braumoeller argues that statistical analysis provides little evidence in support of the psychological mechanisms Pinker proposes, arguing instead that the rise of international institutions better account for declines in the interstate use of force. Within political methodology Braumoeller is best known for developing statistical tests tailored to the kinds of hypotheses common in the study of international relations, in particular, Boolean operators, multiplicative interaction terms, the analysis of necessary conditions, and computational models.",

He immigrated to Canada as a displaced person after the conclusion of the war, and is currently retired and lives in North Bay, Ontario.\nIn 2023, Hunka made international headlines after he was invited to the House of Commons of Canada to be recognized by Speaker Anthony Rota, the Member of Parliament for Hunka's district. On September 22, Hunka received two standing ovations from all house members, including Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Later, Hunka's identity as a former \"Waffen-SS\" member was revealed and reported by the media; as a result, Rota resigned five days later, and the House unanimously adopted a motion to condemn Nazism and withdraw its recognition of Hunka.

It was originally established as the Regia Scuola di Canto, a school for singing in 1819 by Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, and expanded into a conservatory of music in 1825. In 1840 instrumental music instruction began, followed by the addition of music composition, conducting, and other musical studies. \nInitially a school open only to men, the Parma Conservatory became a co-education institution in 1855 known as the Regia Scuola di Musica. In 1888 the school moved from being a private school to a public institution operated by the Government of Italy. Its name was changed to its present title to honor the composer Arrigo Boito in 1919.

Born in 1910 to a family of staunch Presbyterians in Westfield, New Jersey, Jean Clark Dan graduated from Wilson College in Pennsylvania in 1932 where she studied biology. She pursued her graduate studies in invertebrate zoology at the University of Pennsylvania and spent her summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. At the Marine Biological Laboratory she met her future husband and scientific collaborator Katsuma Dan, the son of a prominent Japanese statesman. They were engaged in 1934, the same year that Katsuma Dan received his PhD. Jean received her PhD in 1936 and she and Katsuma were married that same year. Jean and Katsuma then moved to Japan where they continued their research at the Misaki Marine Biological Station of Tokyo University.\nLocated 40 miles from Tokyo, the first three years of World War II limited the supplies available to the Dans. In 1945, the Misaki Station was taken over by the Japanese military for use as a midget submarine base. This forced Jean and her colleagues to relocate to temporary facilities. Jean and Katsuma also raised their five children during the war. After the war, while Katsuma restarted work at Misaki, Jean moved with her children to Nagai. Here she negotiated with the occupying U.S. forces to return land that had been seized by the Japanese military to local farmers. She also negotiated to use garbage from the U.S. army to rehabilitate Japanese villages. Because of this work to improve local living conditions she was nicknamed the \u201cGod of Nagai\u201d.",

His life coincided with the Phanariote reigns, when a series of Wallachian Princes, generally Greeks, enforced Hellenization; Dionisie secretly resented this process, and rallied with a Wallachian conservative patriotism that bordered on Romanian nationalism. Wallachia was also a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, which Dionisie viewed as a detestable overlord. A devout Eastern Orthodox (though he questioned the Ecumenical Patriarchate on political grounds), he spent his life in service to the Metropolis of Wallachia, which is now a component of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Lastly, he displayed a regional allegiance to Oltenia, which was then administered as a Great Banship under Wallachian supervision, and where he spent almost all his life.\nAfter a short career as a married priest, Dionisie became a prolific scribe, finishing he Dobru\u0219a beadroll in 1777. He was treasured by the R\u00e2mnic Archdiocese, where he served administrative functions while also becoming a highly skilled calligrapher in several languages. His historical writing is unusual for its context in that it relies heavily on first-hand experiences\u2014one of the first such events is the Austro-Turkish War of 1788, during which Dionisie and his fellow monks were held as hostages in Craiova. The war also gave him what may have been his only experience of life outside Wallachia, namely an extended tour of Habsburg Hungary. Marginalized upon his return, he withdrew into regular monastic life, witnessing Oltenia's ruin, brought on by warlord Osman Pazvanto\u011flu\u2014whom he depicted as a half-legendary figure\u2014and the economic constraints introduced by the Napoleonic Wars. In his later chronicle, he depicts Napoleon as a negative figure, recording some of the rumors which circulated in respect to him; he also published translations of works dealing with Napoleon's eventual defeat.",

He confronted the boy, who was sleeping in the stable with the horse's blanket wrapped around him. He tied the boy up and then beat him to death. Pitman was arrested and charged with murder. Although blacks were not allowed to serve as witnesses at the time, he was found guilty after his own son and daughter testified against him in court. \"The Virginia Gazette\" summarized the case on April 21, 1775. \"The evidences against William Pitman were his own son and daughter, by whom it appeared that their father, in the heat of passion, and when in liquor, had, for some trifling offence, tied his poor negro boy by the neck and heels, beat him most cruelly with a large grape vine, and then stamped him to death. This man has justly incurred the penalties of the law and we hear will certainly suffer; which ought to be a warning to others to treat their slaves with moderation, and not give way to unruly passions that may bring them to an ignominious death and involve their families in their unhappy fates.\" The Virginia Governor's Council declined to intervene in the case. Pitman was hanged in Williamsburg on May 12, 1775. \"The Gazette\" reported on the execution.\"Pitman made some resistance, but was soon overpowered; he behaved with decency at the place of execution, and attributed his unhappy fate to be the effect of intemperate drinking.\"",

Stacked atop its booster, Super Heavy, it composes the identically named Starship super heavy-lift space vehicle. The spacecraft is designed to transport both crew and cargo to a variety of destinations, including Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and potentially beyond. It is intended to enable long duration interplanetary flights for a crew of up to 100 people. It will also be capable of point-to-point transport on Earth, enabling travel to anywhere in the world in less than an hour. Furthermore, the spacecraft will be used to refuel other Starship vehicles to allow them to reach higher orbits and other space destinations. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, estimated in a tweet that 8 launches would be needed to completely refuel a Starship in Low Earth Orbit, having extrapolated this by using Starship's payload to orbit and combining it with how much fuel a fully fueled Starship contains. To land on bodies without an atmosphere, such as the Moon, Starship will fire its engines and thrusters to slow down.\nDevelopment began in 2012, when Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, described a plan to build a reusable rocket system with substantially greater capabilities than the Falcon 9 and the planned Falcon Heavy. The rocket evolved through many design and name changes. On July 25, 2019, the \"Starhopper\" prototype performed the first successful flight at SpaceX Starbase near Boca Chica, Texas. The SN15 prototype became the first full-size test spacecraft to take off and land successfully in May 2021. On April 20, 2023, Ship 24 and Booster 7 lifted off the pad, the first time the booster and starship flew together as a fully integrated stack.",

He dedicated to him an anthology of \"adab\" in twenty-five chapters, \"\u02bfAj\u0101\u02beib al-ash\u02bf\u0101r wa-ghar\u0101\u02beib al-akhb\u0101r\", of which a single medieval manuscript is preserved, dated 1291 and now in Peshawar. In 1225, he composed another anthology in sixteen books, \"Jamharat al-Isl\u0101m dh\u0101t al-nathr wa \u02bel-ni\u1e93\u0101m\", for the Ayyubid governor al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd \u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 al-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf. He included poems by himself and his son A\u1e25mad. The \"Jamharat\" is preserved in a single manuscript dated 1298 and now in Leiden. A second work dedicated to al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd is the \"\u02bf\u0100d\u0101t al-nuj\u016bm\", known from a manuscript copied in 1665 or 1666 and now in \u1e62an\u02bf\u0101\u02be.

On September 22, Hunka received two standing ovations from all house members, including Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Later, Hunka's identity as a former \"Waffen-SS\" member was revealed and reported by the media; as a result, Rota resigned five days later, and the House unanimously adopted a motion to condemn Nazism and withdraw its recognition of Hunka. Prime Minister Trudeau and Canadian government officials apologized to the worldwide Jewish community.

The son of Pierre de La Vieuville, the marquis followed his father into the service of the new duc de Nevers (duke of Nevers), receiving the office of goveror of the key border city of M\u00e9zi\u00e8res in 1569. Over the following decades he would be a consistent client of the Nevers family, while also acting as a firm royalist in Champagne. To this end he became a \"gentilhomme de la chambre\" for the king of Navarre in 1573. The following year, Nevers saw him established as lieutenant-general of the Reth\u00e9lois, of which Nevers was duc. He acquired lands from his patron by acting as their creditor, most notably in 1576. In 1577 he was granted a \"compagnie d'ordonnance\" (ordinance company) and he was later to be inducted as a \"conseiller d'\u00c9tat\" (councillor of state) in 1580. Over his career he would become a \"chevalier\" (knight) of both the most senior orders of French chivalry, Saint Michel in 1580 and Saint-Esprit in 1599. \nIn 1584 the Duc de Guise established a Catholic \"Ligue\" (League) to oppose the succession of the Protestant king of Navarre to the throne. This \"ligue\" entered war with the crown in 1585 and in furtherance of elevating his position in Champagne (a province of which he was also governor), Guise sought to oust La Vieuville from M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, on the grounds that La Vieuville was too royalist. To appease Nevers, Guise selected an intimate of his the comte de Grandpr\u00e9 to replace La Vieuville, establishing him in the city. However in negotiations for peace with the crown in July, Catherine, negotiating for her son the king, refused to concede the governorship of M\u00e9zi\u00e8res to Grandpr\u00e9 and thus La Vieuville was left in charge. In 1586 Nevers himself spoke in favour of transferring the governate, and La Vieuville was temporarily dispossesed, though he would be back in the office by 1587. As relations with the \"ligue\" again collapsed in 1588, the king decided to assassinate the duc de Guise in December 1588. This destroyed royal authority in Champagne, with the majority of cities defecting to the \"ligue\". La Vieuville tried to preserve M\u00e9zi\u00e8res for the crown, but was arrested by the citizens of the city in April, though released shortly thereafter. Over the following years La Vieuville fought for the royalist cause but was unable to recapture M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, which only defected to the royalist cause in 1595. In 1597 he fought alongside the young new duc de Nevers and orchestrated the French recapture of Reims. In 1607 the lieutenant-general of Champagne died, and the charge was broken into four, with La Vieuville made lieutenant-general of Reims, Rocroi, Sainte-Menehould, Villefranche, Maubert-Fontaine and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. He died in 1612 and was succeeded to his charges by his son Charles de La Vieuville.",

He partnered with his brothers Hugh Hagan and Alexander Hagan, as well as with his maternal uncles, Hugh McDonald and Alexander McDonald. \nAccording to historian Walter Johnson, \"John Hagan's yearly routine began in Charleston with slave buying during June and July; he continued in Virginia and then was back in Charleston in September, still buying, before traveling to New Orleans in October.\" Hagan was both a shipper and consignee (intended recipient) of enslaved people who were on the \"Creole\" in 1841. Before his death in 1856 he worked assiduously to manumit a young enslaved woman from Virginia named Lucy Ann Cheatam, and her two children, Frederika Bremer \"Dolly\" Cheatam and William Lowdnes Cheatam. He also provided bequests of cash and real estate for her in two versions of his will. Per historian Alexandra J. Finley, these children, and two others who died young, were almost certainly Hagan's biological offspring.",
