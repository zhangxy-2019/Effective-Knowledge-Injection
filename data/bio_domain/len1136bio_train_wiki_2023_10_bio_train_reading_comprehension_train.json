      "output": "<The Papess Joanne  - Wikipedia> The Papess Joanne is a 1866 novel by Greek writter Emmanuel Rhoides. Published with the subtitle \"medieval study\", the novel is an exploration of the European legend of Pope Joan, a woman who secretely reigned as pope some time in the late ninth century. Though a romance with satirical overtones, it has been described as having elements of a chronicle because of the writer's extensive research of historical sources.

Braumoeller was an American political scientist studying international conflict, international order, statistical methodology, and computational models. At the time of his death (May 2, 2023) he was a Professor of Political Science at The Ohio State University, where he held the Baronov and Timashev Chair in Data Analytics. He founded the MESO (Modelling Emergent Social Order) Lab and co-led the Computational Social Science Community of Practice at Ohio State's Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI). Braumoeller graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago in 1990 with a B.A. in Political Science writing his senior thesis under Stephen Walt. In 1998 he completed his PhD in Political Science at the University of Michigan under Robert Axelrod with a thesis titled \"Isolationism in International Relations.\" He began his career in 1998 as an assistant professor of Political Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, moving to Harvard University's Department of Government from 2000-2007, before arriving at Ohio State. He was a visiting fellow at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in 2016, and was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2021.\nWithin international relations, Braumoeller is best known for developing the first systemic theory of international relations amenable to statistical testing, culminating in his first book, The Great Powers and the International System: Systemic Theory in Empirical Perspective. The book synthesizes realist and liberal theories of international relations specifying the ways in which individual leaders create the contours of the system that in turn constrain their actions. The book won the 2014 Annual Best Book Award from the International Studies Association and the 2013 J. David Singer Book Award from the ISA-Midwest Conference. More recently Braumoeller published, Only the Dead: The Persistence of War in the Modern Age, the first book length critique of Steven Pinker's claims about the decline of violence in The Better Angels of Our Nature. Braumoeller argues that statistical analysis provides little evidence in support of the psychological mechanisms Pinker proposes, arguing instead that the rise of international institutions better account for declines in the interstate use of force. Within political methodology Braumoeller is best known for developing statistical tests tailored to the kinds of hypotheses common in the study of international relations, in particular, Boolean operators, multiplicative interaction terms, the analysis of necessary conditions, and computational models.\n\nAnswer the questions based on the article:\n\nQuestion: Write a title:\nAnswer:Bear F.

He was a visiting fellow at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in 2016, and was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2021.\nWithin international relations, Braumoeller is best known for developing the first systemic theory of international relations amenable to statistical testing, culminating in his first book, The Great Powers and the International System: Systemic Theory in Empirical Perspective. The book synthesizes realist and liberal theories of international relations specifying the ways in which individual leaders create the contours of the system that in turn constrain their actions. The book won the 2014 Annual Best Book Award from the International Studies Association and the 2013 J. David Singer Book Award from the ISA-Midwest Conference. More recently Braumoeller published, Only the Dead: The Persistence of War in the Modern Age, the first book length critique of Steven Pinker's claims about the decline of violence in The Better Angels of Our Nature. Braumoeller argues that statistical analysis provides little evidence in support of the psychological mechanisms Pinker proposes, arguing instead that the rise of international institutions better account for declines in the interstate use of force. Within political methodology Braumoeller is best known for developing statistical tests tailored to the kinds of hypotheses common in the study of international relations, in particular, Boolean operators, multiplicative interaction terms, the analysis of necessary conditions, and computational models.\n\nQuestion: Highlight the key information within the article:\nAnswer:Harvard University's; May 2, 2023; The Ohio State University; the American Association for the Advancement of Science; the International Studies Association; Political Science; Kappa; Timashev Chair; the University of Chicago; TDAI; Baronov; Department of Government; 2016; PhD; Translational Data Analytics Institute; Stephen Walt; the University of Michigan; Ohio State's; 2000-2007; the Computational Social Science Community of Practice; 2014; first; The Great Powers; the International System: Systemic Theory in Empirical Perspective; Boolean; Urbana-Champaign; 2021; 1998; Robert Axelrod; MESO; Bear F.

Born in 1910 to a family of staunch Presbyterians in Westfield, New Jersey, Jean Clark Dan graduated from Wilson College in Pennsylvania in 1932 where she studied biology. She pursued her graduate studies in invertebrate zoology at the University of Pennsylvania and spent her summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. At the Marine Biological Laboratory she met her future husband and scientific collaborator Katsuma Dan, the son of a prominent Japanese statesman. They were engaged in 1934, the same year that Katsuma Dan received his PhD. Jean received her PhD in 1936 and she and Katsuma were married that same year. Jean and Katsuma then moved to Japan where they continued their research at the Misaki Marine Biological Station of Tokyo University.\nLocated 40 miles from Tokyo, the first three years of World War II limited the supplies available to the Dans. In 1945, the Misaki Station was taken over by the Japanese military for use as a midget submarine base. This forced Jean and her colleagues to relocate to temporary facilities.

      "output": "<SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)  - Wikipedia> Starship is a spacecraft currently under development by American aerospace company SpaceX. Stacked atop its booster, Super Heavy, it composes the identically named Starship super heavy-lift space vehicle. The spacecraft is designed to transport both crew and cargo to a variety of destinations, including Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and potentially beyond. It is intended to enable long duration interplanetary flights for a crew of up to 100 people. It will also be capable of point-to-point transport on Earth, enabling travel to anywhere in the world in less than an hour. Furthermore, the spacecraft will be used to refuel other Starship vehicles to allow them to reach higher orbits and other space destinations. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, estimated in a tweet that 8 launches would be needed to completely refuel a Starship in Low Earth Orbit, having extrapolated this by using Starship's payload to orbit and combining it with how much fuel a fully fueled Starship contains. To land on bodies without an atmosphere, such as the Moon, Starship will fire its engines and thrusters to slow down.\nDevelopment began in 2012, when Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, described a plan to build a reusable rocket system with substantially greater capabilities than the Falcon 9 and the planned Falcon Heavy. The rocket evolved through many design and name changes. On July 25, 2019, the \"Starhopper\" prototype performed the first successful flight at SpaceX Starbase near Boca Chica, Texas. The SN15 prototype became the first full-size test spacecraft to take off and land successfully in May 2021.

      "output": "<Robert de La Vieuville  - Wikipedia> Robert de La Vieuville, marquis de Sy (\u20131612) was a French governor and military commander in Champagne and the Reth\u00e9lois during the French Wars of Religion. The son of Pierre de La Vieuville, the marquis followed his father into the service of the new duc de Nevers (duke of Nevers), receiving the office of goveror of the key border city of M\u00e9zi\u00e8res in 1569. Over the following decades he would be a consistent client of the Nevers family, while also acting as a firm royalist in Champagne. To this end he became a \"gentilhomme de la chambre\" for the king of Navarre in 1573. The following year, Nevers saw him established as lieutenant-general of the Reth\u00e9lois, of which Nevers was duc. He acquired lands from his patron by acting as their creditor, most notably in 1576. In 1577 he was granted a \"compagnie d'ordonnance\" (ordinance company) and he was later to be inducted as a \"conseiller d'\u00c9tat\" (councillor of state) in 1580. Over his career he would become a \"chevalier\" (knight) of both the most senior orders of French chivalry, Saint Michel in 1580 and Saint-Esprit in 1599. \nIn 1584 the Duc de Guise established a Catholic \"Ligue\" (League) to oppose the succession of the Protestant king of Navarre to the throne. This \"ligue\" entered war with the crown in 1585 and in furtherance of elevating his position in Champagne (a province of which he was also governor), Guise sought to oust La Vieuville from M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, on the grounds that La Vieuville was too royalist. To appease Nevers, Guise selected an intimate of his the comte de Grandpr\u00e9 to replace La Vieuville, establishing him in the city. However in negotiations for peace with the crown in July, Catherine, negotiating for her son the king, refused to concede the governorship of M\u00e9zi\u00e8res to Grandpr\u00e9 and thus La Vieuville was left in charge. In 1586 Nevers himself spoke in favour of transferring the governate, and La Vieuville was temporarily dispossesed, though he would be back in the office by 1587. As relations with the \"ligue\" again collapsed in 1588, the king decided to assassinate the duc de Guise in December 1588. This destroyed royal authority in Champagne, with the majority of cities defecting to the \"ligue\". La Vieuville tried to preserve M\u00e9zi\u00e8res for the crown, but was arrested by the citizens of the city in April, though released shortly thereafter. Over the following years La Vieuville fought for the royalist cause but was unable to recapture M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, which only defected to the royalist cause in 1595. In 1597 he fought alongside the young new duc de Nevers and orchestrated the French recapture of Reims. In 1607 the lieutenant-general of Champagne died, and the charge was broken into four, with La Vieuville made lieutenant-general of Reims, Rocroi, Sainte-Menehould, Villefranche, Maubert-Fontaine and M\u00e9zi\u00e8res.
